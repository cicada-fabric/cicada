# Native App N1 validation

This record covers the bounded Core, wire-helper, and local issuer checks for
the Native App foundation. The commands ran on 2026-10-15 against the shared
dirty development worktree based on `2afcc860da716bf3e9e574d9049a35d6dbba0081`.
The results belong to that tested source state, including its uncommitted files;
they are not attributed to the base revision alone. They do not qualify a
release or a native Windows runtime.

## Product behavior exercised

The Core tests use a private synthetic Hub Store and a real loopback TCP HTTP
server. They drive claim prepare/complete, login prepare/complete, session
inspect, and logout through the Hub handler and App packet sealing/opening. The
fixture checks exact lost-response recovery after controller/vault restart,
including the case where a proxy returns an unsigned 403 after the Hub has
accepted the packet. The App retains the original ciphertext and retries only
that exact request. A forced vault failure before send produces no HTTP request.
The flow leaves Root in `PENDING_PROOF` and does not expose Manager authority.

The existing-Owner import test verifies an imported synthetic keypair is kept
as-is in the encrypted local vault. Import does not enroll an App device, send
account requests, activate Root, or create a grant. The account code/framing
tests exercise canonical parsing and reject malformed or URL-like values. The
local issuer tests verify the compact code is omitted from ordinary output,
written only to a new 0600 file when requested, or displayed only after the
real terminal check succeeds.

These tests use generated public cryptographic fixtures and isolated temporary
state. No resident Hub, production key, credential, or deployment state was
used.

## Commands and results

All Go commands ran in
`golang:1.27.1-bookworm@sha256:69a7b9788769bec032d238959b61854e9ae87f57be9029ec04e9885fabf99195`
with the shared module cache mounted read-only and network disabled.

```sh
go test -mod=readonly -p=2 -count=1 -timeout=90s ./internal/appcore ./internal/hubaccountwire \
  -run '^Test(ExistingOwnerImportCreatesEncryptedLocalVaultWithoutAuthority|ControllerRealHTTPAccountFlowAndExactUncertainRecovery|OwnerAccountClaimCodeRoundTripAndStrictFraming|ActivationAndConnectionCardBoundaries|NativeCoreSnapshotAndPasswordPreflight)$'
```

PASS: `internal/appcore` and `internal/hubaccountwire`.

```sh
go test -mod=readonly -p=2 -count=1 -timeout=90s ./cmd/cicada \
  -run 'TestHubAccount(ClaimIssueProtectsCardAndHidesCodeFromDefaultOutput|AppCodeDisplayRequiresAndUsesInteractiveTTY|ClaimIssueRefusesAfterPermanentRootHistory)$'
```

PASS: protected claim/code issuance, default secret suppression, interactive
code display, and refusal after permanent Root history.

```sh
go test -mod=readonly -race -p=2 -count=1 -timeout=120s ./internal/appcore ./internal/hubaccountwire
```

PASS: appcore in 31.719 seconds; hubaccountwire in 1.645 seconds.

```sh
go vet -mod=readonly ./internal/appcore ./internal/hubaccountwire ./cmd/cicada
```

PASS: no diagnostics.

The unified native foundation gate then passed from the frozen Go source tree:

```sh
scripts/test-native-app.sh
```

PASS: 55 test events, 0 failures, 0 skipped tests across the eight packages
with test files. The ninth package, `cmd/cicada-app`, compiled but has no test
files. The before/after Go-source manifest matched at
`b5f32aab304ce52c0631bb59f0f78f36cd544aa47e72d1abc0d7facd677bd689`. The run
used the same pinned builder image, with a visibly synthetic OpenSSL fixture
configured for the selected key-import tests.

After the gate, the runner's default module-cache path was changed to the
canonical shared `.cicada-data/m1-gomodcache`. That script-only adjustment did
not change Go source. After the shared module cache was merged without
overwriting existing entries, `go mod verify` passed for all modules. Root then
reran the same gate using the canonical cache: 55 passed test events, 0
failures, 0 skipped tests, and a stable before/after Go-source manifest
`099bbc8ba2f8e72eeba8174c065c6b183fba6ceeec5cf3e7565c4a774e4ac5ee`. The only
manifest difference from the first run was the runner script's cache default;
the Go sources were unchanged. The Windows binary was byte-identical to the
first gate.

The latest machine-readable result is
[`validation.json`](../.cicada-data/native-app-foundation/run-20261015T061122Z-CiZENQ/validation.json),
SHA-256 `19ab32b935cefa34449285c83448451dac8077991a81559b3dbfbc4c9a9333b5`.
The initial pre-cache-change gate remains at
[`the first result`](../.cicada-data/native-app-foundation/run-20261015T060350Z-UNLVmo/validation.json),
SHA-256 `281c7f756e2dc5ce4cd4c94d9279a1773bd7404f56961f2ced7ff6afe36f4806`.

The same gate cross-built the Windows GUI executable with
`CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64`. The binary is 12,674,048 bytes with
SHA-256 `d1755e06e505779359d8bb9f742093bfc72bd3197d389deb568c0c89ee61d448`.
This proves cross-compilation only; Windows runtime execution is `NOT_RUN`.
The build dependency audit listed 141 non-standard packages, recorded in the
artifact directory. The native App has not passed Windows DPAPI/ACL or
real-desktop execution checks.

Both gate result files record `source_head` as
`2afcc860da716bf3e9e574d9049a35d6dbba0081` and `source_dirty: true`; their
results belong to the matching tested manifests, not to that base revision
alone.

An earlier mixed preflight is retained at
[`foundation-tests.jsonl`](../.cicada-data/native-app-root-20261015/foundation-tests.jsonl),
SHA-256 `6ec1af34ffbd1c00f2488982d1b5a08bb29b872aea8b07debd9c90d207969369`.
It recorded 13 appkeys/appvault test passes but failed the dependent UI build
because the first exported claim-code size expression called a function where
a compile-time constant was required. The expression was corrected; the
final unified gate above passed. The earlier failure remains an intermediate
preflight result, not a current product failure or a pass.

## Disposable standard Client interop

The official standard Client Docker interop suite passed against a disposable
Hub built from the same dirty base revision, with source fingerprint
`bf9494948f45ff4f19a32b2d3c930a0d7597497950d63a5c62b5aea1a5948f05` and image
`sha256:c32da42c3a6c3378e5b71e50d37c65be011f7f930dea073b9c6a618f89c928cd`.
Smoke, recovery-fixture, headless-operator, and Owner-bootstrap tests all
passed; the runner exited 0. Cleanup was confirmed for the disposable
containers, images, and scratch directory, and Root independently verified
the six resident container names were unchanged. No resident image was
replaced.

The result is
[`result.json`](../.cicada-data/native-app-root-20261015/hub-interop/result.json),
SHA-256 `c890f662963baa9b9dfbd9d67538c117f3be9d1f7049655a051f10d302ca22ea`;
cleanup evidence is [`cleanup.json`](../.cicada-data/native-app-root-20261015/hub-interop/cleanup.json),
SHA-256 `c6a802d5297743f2d519fa1167549eff2b231ac9bd1d3025677dc74ca7a8c231`.
This gate validates the existing standard Client protocol on a real TCP Hub.
It is not a native App end-to-end test: the result records native runtime,
Android, and public HTTPS as `NOT_RUN`.

## Limits and pending evidence

This is a selected deterministic Core/wire/CLI checkpoint, not a full Go
repository test run. The combined native UI/vault/key gate and Windows
cross-build passed on the same frozen Go source manifest; neither proves
native Windows execution. Standard Client Docker interop also passed, within
the separate scope above. Native Windows DPAPI/ACL execution, strict PQTLS
negotiation, Android, physical-device use, public HTTPS, and authorized live
canvas/Node actions are not established here. See the [ordered Native App plan](native-app-plan.md)
for the remaining checkpoints and the [current architecture status](architecture-v2-status.md)
for broader product evidence.

The current GUI-facing error state cannot treat an unsigned HTTP status as an
authoritative account rejection. Consequently, if the Hub did not accept a
claim/login packet but an intermediary returns an unsigned error, the App
keeps the exact request uncertain and offers exact recovery; it does not issue
a replacement request or discard the pending packet. Basic password length
and encoding checks run locally, while authoritative policy feedback requires
a validated encrypted Hub response. This is a deliberate N1 recovery bound;
it does not grant account or Root authority.
