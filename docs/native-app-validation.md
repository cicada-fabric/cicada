# Native App N1 validation

This record covers the bounded Core, wire-helper, and local issuer checks for
the Native App foundation. The commands ran on 2026-10-15 against the shared
dirty development worktree based on `2afcc860da716bf3e9e574d9049a35d6dbba0081`.
The results belong to that tested source state, including its uncommitted files;
they are not attributed to the base revision alone. They do not qualify a
release or a native Windows runtime.

## Product behavior exercised

The Core tests use a private synthetic Hub Store and a real loopback TCP HTTP
server. They drive claim prepare/complete, login prepare/complete, session
inspect, and logout through the Hub handler and App packet sealing/opening. The
fixture checks exact lost-response recovery after controller/vault restart,
including the case where a proxy returns an unsigned 403 after the Hub has
accepted the packet. The App retains the original ciphertext and retries only
that exact request. A forced vault failure before send produces no HTTP request.
The flow leaves Root in `PENDING_PROOF` and does not expose Manager authority.

The existing-Owner import test verifies an imported synthetic keypair is kept
as-is in the encrypted local vault. Import does not enroll an App device, send
account requests, activate Root, or create a grant. The account code/framing
tests exercise canonical parsing and reject malformed or URL-like values. The
local issuer tests verify the compact code is omitted from ordinary output,
written only to a new 0600 file when requested, or displayed only after the
real terminal check succeeds.

These tests use generated public cryptographic fixtures and isolated temporary
state. No resident Hub, production key, credential, or deployment state was
used.

## Commands and results

All Go commands ran in
`golang:1.27.1-bookworm@sha256:69a7b9788769bec032d238959b61854e9ae87f57be9029ec04e9885fabf99195`
with the shared module cache mounted read-only and network disabled.

```sh
go test -mod=readonly -p=2 -count=1 -timeout=90s ./internal/appcore ./internal/hubaccountwire \
  -run '^Test(ExistingOwnerImportCreatesEncryptedLocalVaultWithoutAuthority|ControllerRealHTTPAccountFlowAndExactUncertainRecovery|OwnerAccountClaimCodeRoundTripAndStrictFraming|ActivationAndConnectionCardBoundaries|NativeCoreSnapshotAndPasswordPreflight)$'
```

PASS: `internal/appcore` and `internal/hubaccountwire`.

```sh
go test -mod=readonly -p=2 -count=1 -timeout=90s ./cmd/cicada \
  -run 'TestHubAccount(ClaimIssueProtectsCardAndHidesCodeFromDefaultOutput|AppCodeDisplayRequiresAndUsesInteractiveTTY|ClaimIssueRefusesAfterPermanentRootHistory)$'
```

PASS: protected claim/code issuance, default secret suppression, interactive
code display, and refusal after permanent Root history.

```sh
go test -mod=readonly -race -p=2 -count=1 -timeout=120s ./internal/appcore ./internal/hubaccountwire
```

PASS: appcore in 31.719 seconds; hubaccountwire in 1.645 seconds.

```sh
go vet -mod=readonly ./internal/appcore ./internal/hubaccountwire ./cmd/cicada
```

PASS: no diagnostics.

The unified native foundation gate then passed from the frozen Go source tree:

```sh
scripts/test-native-app.sh
```

PASS: 55 test events, 0 failures, 0 skipped tests across the eight packages
with test files. The ninth package, `cmd/cicada-app`, compiled but has no test
files. The before/after Go-source manifest matched at
`b5f32aab304ce52c0631bb59f0f78f36cd544aa47e72d1abc0d7facd677bd689`. The run
used the same pinned builder image, with a visibly synthetic OpenSSL fixture
configured for the selected key-import tests.

After the gate, the runner's default module-cache path was changed to the
canonical shared `.cicada-data/m1-gomodcache`. That script-only adjustment did
not change Go source. After the shared module cache was merged without
overwriting existing entries, `go mod verify` passed for all modules. Root then
reran the same gate using the canonical cache: 55 passed test events, 0
failures, 0 skipped tests, and a stable before/after Go-source manifest
`099bbc8ba2f8e72eeba8174c065c6b183fba6ceeec5cf3e7565c4a774e4ac5ee`. The only
manifest difference from the first run was the runner script's cache default;
the Go sources were unchanged. The Windows binary was byte-identical to the
first gate.

The latest machine-readable result is
[`validation.json`](../.cicada-data/native-app-foundation/run-20261015T061122Z-CiZENQ/validation.json),
SHA-256 `19ab32b935cefa34449285c83448451dac8077991a81559b3dbfbc4c9a9333b5`.
The initial pre-cache-change gate remains at
[`the first result`](../.cicada-data/native-app-foundation/run-20261015T060350Z-UNLVmo/validation.json),
SHA-256 `281c7f756e2dc5ce4cd4c94d9279a1773bd7404f56961f2ced7ff6afe36f4806`.

The same gate cross-built the Windows GUI executable with
`CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64`. The binary is 12,674,048 bytes with
SHA-256 `d1755e06e505779359d8bb9f742093bfc72bd3197d389deb568c0c89ee61d448`.
This proves cross-compilation only; Windows runtime execution is `NOT_RUN`.
The build dependency audit listed 141 non-standard packages, recorded in the
artifact directory. The native App has not passed Windows DPAPI/ACL or
real-desktop execution checks.

Both gate result files record `source_head` as
`2afcc860da716bf3e9e574d9049a35d6dbba0081` and `source_dirty: true`; their
results belong to the matching tested manifests, not to that base revision
alone.

An earlier mixed preflight is retained at
[`foundation-tests.jsonl`](../.cicada-data/native-app-root-20261015/foundation-tests.jsonl),
SHA-256 `6ec1af34ffbd1c00f2488982d1b5a08bb29b872aea8b07debd9c90d207969369`.
It recorded 13 appkeys/appvault test passes but failed the dependent UI build
because the first exported claim-code size expression called a function where
a compile-time constant was required. The expression was corrected; the
final unified gate above passed. The earlier failure remains an intermediate
preflight result, not a current product failure or a pass.

## Disposable standard Client interop

The official standard Client Docker interop suite passed against a disposable
Hub built from the same dirty base revision, with source fingerprint
`bf9494948f45ff4f19a32b2d3c930a0d7597497950d63a5c62b5aea1a5948f05` and image
`sha256:c32da42c3a6c3378e5b71e50d37c65be011f7f930dea073b9c6a618f89c928cd`.
Smoke, recovery-fixture, headless-operator, and Owner-bootstrap tests all
passed; the runner exited 0. Cleanup was confirmed for the disposable
containers, images, and scratch directory, and Root independently verified
the six resident container names were unchanged. No resident image was
replaced.

The result is
[`result.json`](../.cicada-data/native-app-root-20261015/hub-interop/result.json),
SHA-256 `c890f662963baa9b9dfbd9d67538c117f3be9d1f7049655a051f10d302ca22ea`;
cleanup evidence is [`cleanup.json`](../.cicada-data/native-app-root-20261015/hub-interop/cleanup.json),
SHA-256 `c6a802d5297743f2d519fa1167549eff2b231ac9bd1d3025677dc74ca7a8c231`.
This gate validates the existing standard Client protocol on a real TCP Hub.
It is not a native App end-to-end test: the result records native runtime,
Android, and public HTTPS as `NOT_RUN`.

## Limits and pending evidence

This is a selected deterministic Core/wire/CLI checkpoint, not a full Go
repository test run. The combined native UI/vault/key gate and Windows
cross-build passed on the same frozen Go source manifest; neither proves
native Windows execution. Standard Client Docker interop also passed, within
the separate scope above. Native Windows DPAPI/ACL execution, strict PQTLS
negotiation, Android, physical-device use, public HTTPS, and authorized live
canvas/Node actions are not established here. See the [ordered Native App plan](native-app-plan.md)
for the remaining checkpoints and the [current architecture status](architecture-v2-status.md)
for broader product evidence.

The current GUI-facing error state cannot treat an unsigned HTTP status as an
authoritative account rejection. Consequently, if the Hub did not accept a
claim/login packet but an intermediary returns an unsigned error, the App
keeps the exact request uncertain and offers exact recovery; it does not issue
a replacement request or discard the pending packet. Basic password length
and encoding checks run locally, while authoritative policy feedback requires
a validated encrypted Hub response. This is a deliberate N1 recovery bound;
it does not grant account or Root authority.

## N2 independent account baseline

On 2026-10-15 the independent acceptance task reviewed the Hub account service,
Owner bootstrap service, App Controller, scoped encrypted vault and existing
ML-KEM-768 / ML-DSA-65 / AES-256-GCM wire code at base `c1b6a30`. N2 activation
and controlled legacy continuation were absent from that source. The threat
model is in [architecture](native-app-architecture.md#n2-independent-threat-model)
and the complete fault matrix is in [the plan](native-app-plan.md#n2-independent-acceptance-matrix).

The new `cicada-go/acceptance/n2` consumer starts the production Hub
identity/account handler with no Control service. Both Hub and App run in
separate subprocesses. A real TCP proxy injects loss before forwarding, loss
after a successful Hub response, an unsigned 403 after commit, and a corrupt
PQ response. For each of claim prepare/complete, login prepare/complete,
inspection and logout, the driver SIGKILLs the App and Hub, reopens the same
SQLite database and encrypted vault, and verifies the exact original request
hash and, after a commit, immutable original response hash. This is Linux App
core protocol acceptance, not Windows GUI execution or shipping Hub CLI
composition acceptance.

Additional negative tests cover full Hub pin mismatch and expired connection
material before vault creation/POST, two simultaneous distinct account claim
candidates, consumed exact versus resealed requests, foreign Hub/Owner routes,
missing/bad App signature/ciphertext, substituted login-device key and
cookie-only inspection. The accepted account remains `PENDING_PROOF`; no
Root or Manager authority is created.

```sh
scripts/test-native-app-n2.sh
# Full acceptance must remain nonzero until the N2 lane exists:
scripts/test-native-app-n2.sh --require-n2
```

The baseline run `run-20261015T123219Z-IyTWRS` exited **0 / SCOPED_PASS**:
58 passing test events, zero failures and zero skips. Compile, process lane,
existing guards, vet and version commands each exited 0. It used the offline
Go 1.27.1 image `sha256:69a7b9788769bec032d238959b61854e9ae87f57be9029ec04e9885fabf99195`
with read-only shared modules and an exclusive task build cache. No host port
was published; loopback TCP stayed inside the network-disabled disposable
container. The owned container was absent afterward.

Evidence is retained outside the repository at
`/home/zyf/Cicada/.local/evidence/n2-acceptance/run-20261015T123219Z-IyTWRS/`:

| Artifact | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| `result.json` | `6df637833f4ffcb84ab18163a27a1e9f1f5a7a2b26f35e005968f5e48e62ca94` |

The source was dirty, based on `c1b6a30`, and stable during that run. Its
manifest, rather than HEAD alone, identifies what was tested. Later driver
changes add portable workspace discovery and explicit resident-container
ID/name/image/start-time comparison; they were not part of that receipt.
The earlier `run-20261015T123111Z-ysm9I6` exited 1 because of acceptance-fixture
cleanup lifetime, nanosecond expiry construction and error-code assertions;
those harness errors were corrected. Its failure is retained and is not a
production defect or an N2 pass.

The baseline's deliberate fail-closed response handling also exposes an N2
recovery requirement: wrong-password rejection and expired/revoked sessions
need an authenticated terminal result or an operation+digest fence before
allowing replacement login. Unsigned HTTP errors alone cannot clear pending
state. This requirement was handed to the Hub/App owners and remains pending
in the N2 matrix. Full activation, exact legacy continuation, expiry/late
lease guards, status fencing and profile discovery are **NOT_RUN** in this
baseline. Windows DPAPI, ACL, GUI and visual review are individually
**NOT_RUN**, as are Android, native Runtime, physical device, public HTTPS and
native PQTLS. The integration owner runs the separate standard Client Docker
interop gate after integration; it is not run or claimed by this lane.

The final preparation driver was rerun with explicit resident selection:

```sh
CICADA_N2_RESIDENT_NAMES=cicada-client-hub-v1-2-manager,cicada-client-hub-v1-2,cicada-client-v11-emulator,cicada-client-hub-v1-1 \
  scripts/test-native-app-n2.sh --require-n2
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts -p test_native_app_n2_evidence.py
```

Run `run-20261015T123800Z-6ulAdI` recorded **SCOPED_PASS** for the same 58 events,
zero failures/skips and five zero-exit lanes. The overall exit was **3**, as
required while N2 is NOT_RUN. Source manifest
`c320615f8629a5f966bf8744597a7367683b7ed2b67da50f7854b892f4a840aa`
was stable; the binary hash stayed `76c17dc5cae8ed1998e44f1bc0b0a0bd56e4160946c3fc65d6a5851ea69f7dab`.
All four resident container IDs, names, immutable images and process start
times matched; the owned container was absent. Result SHA-256 is
`a9b0ada5f2d1e3c1901ddfb69e53a3f753f152dd43062c56072ef5f5baeb3dc4`,
and artifact index SHA-256 is
`939a1146e2a4f608754f9f3c88b6ddab7f1e096b64dd06178b2af308e85df89c`.
The two evidence-tool unit tests passed, including refusal to pass an empty
zero-exit test log. Shell syntax, Python compilation and diff whitespace checks
passed. This remains dirty-source evidence, preceding its documentation update.

An intervening run `run-20261015T123609Z-oXVOm5` also passed all 58 events but
exited 1: its initial resident-discovery heuristic included a concurrently
running anonymous `--rm` Go test container, which then exited. Actual resident
Hub/emulator identities were unchanged. The driver now excludes auto-remove
fixtures by default and supports the explicit resident-name list above. This
is a retained harness classification failure, not a product failure. No
container belonging to another task was modified.
